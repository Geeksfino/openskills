# OpenSkills Project Skills

This directory contains project-shared Cursor skills for recurring OpenSkills development workflows.

## Available Skills

- `openskills-runtime-debug` — Diagnose runtime sandbox and execution failures.
- `openskills-plugin-separation` — Keep build plugins isolated from core runtime compilation paths.
- `openskills-skill-authoring` — Author and validate new `SKILL.md` packages.
- `openskills-e2e-test-runbook` — Run deterministic example-agent and runtime smoke checks.
- `openskills-bindings-maintainer` — Maintain TS/Python bindings compatibility when runtime changes.
- `openskills-release-ops` — Perform release-readiness checks and packaging gates.
- `openskills-dev-orchestrator` — Route tasks to the right skill/subagent and sequence workflows.

## Usage

Ask naturally for the workflow, for example:

- "Debug this sandbox failure in openskills-runtime."
- "Check whether this plugin change leaks into core runtime."
- "Prepare release readiness report for openskills."
